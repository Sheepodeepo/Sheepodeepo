## 👋 About Me 
I'm a recent college graduate looking for Software Engineering roles but also open to Electrical Engineering roles! I'm a developer focused on Backend development especially Springboot. However, I'm open to trying other fields such as Mobile Development with **Swift** and Systems Programming and Lower Level Languages with **C++/Rust**. 

I'm currently learning on more Cloud tools such as AWS with EC2, S3, etc to incorporate and utilize in production environment.
