## 👋 About Me 
I'm a recent college graduate based in the Bay Area! I'm a developer focused on Backend development especially Springboot. However, I've been dabbling in other fields such as Mobile Development with **Swift** and Systems Programming and Lower Level Languages with **C++/Rust**. 

Currently, I've been exploring more engineering solutions using AI through Hackathons creating very interesting real world applications and winning prizes as well! Check out this hackathon winning [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQS5CLRmQZY) of an AI Agent that I especially proud of building with a few friends, integrating RAG and MCP Server/Client to build an AI Agent for Marketing!

### ☁️ Hobbies/Facts 
I love reading manga, watching anime, and reading web-novels. My current top 3 mangas so far are **Vinland Saga**, **Blue Lock**, and **Haikyuu**. I also like playing video games and have played League of Legends, Valorant, Zelda: Breath of the Wild ❤️, and many more!
